    let's consider the following relational schema for our conversation:
    <img src="../relationSchema.png" alt="">
    <h4>Find the SNAMEs of suppliers who supply every red part and every green part. </h4>
    <p>This is an interesting query to write as it could help us to understand the intuition beyond the EXISTS and NOT EXISTS functions.
        The first obvious thing to do is to write a query that gives us PIDs of all reds and green parts. 
        <br>
        <br>
        SELECT PID <br>
        FROM PARTS <br>
        WHERE PARTS.COLOR='red' OR PARTS.COLOR='green'
        <br>
        <br>
        Now we want to look at the parts that are on the CATALOG and being supply by at least a supplier
        <br>
        <br>
        SELECT C.PID <br>
        FROM CATALOG C <br> 

        <br>
        <br>
        Now we want to see what parts ids are not on the the CATALOG if any. Putting the previous two queries together we will get the following:
        <br>
        <br>
        SELECT PID <br>
        FROM PARTS <br>
        WHERE PARTS.COLOR='red' OR PARTS.COLOR='green' <br>
        EXCEPT (SELECT C.PID <br>
        FROM CATALOG C <br> )
        <br>
        So far so good. Now let's get the name of suppliers that supply all reds and green parts. To do that we need to access the 
        SUPPLIERS table. <br>
        <br>
        SELECT SNAMES <br>
        FROM SUPPLIERS <br>
        <br>
        Next step is to make sure we are listing name of suppliers that are active and are supplying at this time. To do that we can pass
        it to the inner query where we are accessing the CATALOG table. 
        <br>
        <br>
        SELECT SNAMES <br>
        FROM SUPPLIERS <br>
        ...... <br>
        SELECT PID <br>
        FROM PARTS <br>
        WHERE PARTS.COLOR='red' OR PARTS.COLOR='green' <br>
        EXCEPT (SELECT C.PID <br>
        FROM CATALOG C <br>
        WHERE SUPPLIERS.SID = CATALOG.SID  )
        <br>
        <br>
        last not least, we need to make sure that there are no parts that exist on the PARTS table which don't show up on the CATALOG.
        To implement this intuition we can use NOT EXISTS function. 
        <br>
        <br>
        SELECT SNAMES <br>
        FROM SUPPLIERS <br>
        WHERE NOT EXISTS( 
        SELECT PID <br>
        FROM PARTS <br>
        WHERE PARTS.COLOR='red' OR PARTS.COLOR='green' <br>
        EXCEPT (SELECT C.PID <br>
        FROM CATALOG C <br>
        WHERE SUPPLIERS.SID = CATALOG.SID  ))
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Find the SNAMEs of suppliers who do not supply every red part.</h4>
